Folder `scalarizingFunction`:
- the weighted Tchebychev scalarizing function
- the augmented weighted Tchebychev scalarizing function

It shows, for a static sample of points $y \in Y$ representing the outcome set for a bi-objective problem, the points selected using one of the two scalarizing function.

Folder `Astar`:
- select one situation (two maps are available)
- select randomly a departure and an arrival
- compute the path with $A^*$ algorithm

It shows, for a given map, the best path from a departure D point and an arrival A point.
